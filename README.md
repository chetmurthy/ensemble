# The Ensemble distributed communications toolkit

This is a copy of the Ensemble distributed communications toolkit, as
gathered from the Internet over a decade ago.  I've restored as many
versions as I could find, in chronological order, and will then bring
the latest version back up-to-speed working on the latest Ocaml
version (4.10.0 as of this writing).

None of the code is mine: Mark Hayden, Ohad Rodeh, and others wrote it
all, and any use/copying is governed by the LICENSE file found herein.
