README: CEJAVA subdirectory
Author: Ohad Rodeh 8/2002

  The CEJAVA directory interfaces Java with the CE interface. The Java
  interface is similar to the C interface in nature. The code was
  inspired by an interface for HOT that Matthias Ernst
  (matthias.ernst@coremedia.com) sent in.

  Preliminary overhead measurements, as measured on Linux, show low
  overhead. One major difference between CE and CEJAVA is that
  messages delivered to the Java application are copied. This costs
  more but provides more safty, i.e., the application can do anything
  it wishes with a received message.
