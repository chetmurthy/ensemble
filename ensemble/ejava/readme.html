<P>This is a readme for the Java interface to Ensemble Outboard.</P>

<P>You may be looking for documentation on the <A HREF="docs/Package-ensemble.hot.html">API</A>.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Compilation Instructions</FONT></P>

<P>There is a makefile (nmake) included in the distribution (ens.mk) which
will work assuming your CLASSPATH points at least to the standard Java
packages and the javac executable is in your PATH. That being said, compilation
proceeds in the normal Java fashion (javac ensemble/hot/Hot_Ensemble.java).</P>

<P>The demo program (EnsDemo) also compiles as usual (javac EnsDemo.java)
and should execute properly provided the ensemble.hot package is in your
CLASSPATH.</P>
