RELEASE_NOTES


* Migrated to using a configuration file (.ensemble.conf) instead of using environment
  variables. 

* Removed CORBA stuff from Maestro

* Removed the more esoteric rekeying protocols. 

* CE: Added an option for asynchronous block/blockOk. 
  Removed socket add/remove from multi-threaded CE API. This is supported only for 
  the single-threaded API. 

* Added an outboard C# client with a new API. 

* Fixed bad handling of TCP sockets. Such sockets were opened in blocking instead 
  of non-blocking mode.

* Improved build sequence

* Small bugs:
   - Updated TCP mode to use the Arge.host_ip option
   - Changed command line option 'udp_host' to 'host_ip'
   - Migrated from CAMLLIB environment variable to the newer OCAMLLIB.
   - Fixed a bug with the AGREE property.

* Updated documentation: 
   - Described how to trace modules.  "-trace <module_name>"
   - Added a document describing outboard messaging. This should all enable people 
     to build their own clients. 
   - Added a document for the TOPS layer that implements the AGREE property
