RELEASE_NOTES

  This release primarily cleans up the maestro code-base. There is now
just one code for all platforms with relatively few "ifdefs". From the
next release the CORBA/GIOP code included in Maestro will not be
supported. Aside from a maestro cleanup several bugs have been fixed: 
1. A maestro bug due to a miscalculation of the previous group leader
2. A total-ordering bug in the Seqbb protocol
3. A bug that prevented the use of a user-specified IP address for an Ensemble process


OCAML COMPILER VERSION
  We are using version 3.06 for this version. 

PORTABILITY
  This version was tested on Linux (RedHat 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, i386 architecture) and windows XP.
