     RELEASE_NOTES for Ensemble version 1.00

   **** Final Cornell University Supported Release ****

Author: Tim Clark
Last updated: 8/16/2000

FINAL RELEASE NOTICE

This release, 1.00, is the final release from Cornell University.
We believe Ensemble has become stable and robust enough that it 
no longer needs full-time support.  As a result, Cornell will no
longer provide support for Ensemble.  Support will, however, be
continued via the Ensemble developers' listsrv, HORUS-L@cornell.edu.


OCAML COMPILER VERSION

This distribution of Ensemble should be compiled with the Ocaml 3.00 
compiler.  See INSTALL.htm for instructions on downloading this version 
of Ocaml.


ADDED FUNCTIONALITY

* Updated security features have been added to this release.  The
  security protocols are documented in the ensemble/doc/ref.ps file.
  Support for security has been added to the HOT and Ejava interfaces.
  With this release, we believe the security work is complete.

* The security documentation has been updated.


KNOWN PROBLEMS/BUGS

LINUX:

* There may be a performance irregularity on Linux when using the "C" 
  or C++ interface.  This version of Ensemble uses the sched_yield()
  call to yield the processor.  However, we have seen the performance
  to be quite variable, which we believe is due to thread scheduling
  in the Linux pthreads implementation.

NT:

* On NT, DNS problems can cause processes to hang or perform poorly. 
  This will affect the gossip server and any other processes which 
  do DNS lookups.  It should be noted, however, that this is a 
  CONFIGURATION problem, not an Ensemble bug.  If the gossip server
  or your process appears to hang, first check your DNS server.
  
* There is a known performance bug in the NT "C"/C++ interface which
  will effect ping-pong style communication (e.g. rapid RPCs from 
  one process to another, as in the hot_test2 demo).  On NT, when 
  Ensemble has nothing to do, it blocks for 1/10 second.  In certain 
  scenarios, this can reduce throughput to 10 msgs per second.  A fix 
  is to set a smaller heartbeat value in your application (in millisecs).
  This will limit how long Ensemble will block.  An internal fix will 
  be available in the near future.  If this is a problem for your 
  application, and you would like more information, please contact 
  Tim Clark at (tclark@cs.cornell.edu).
