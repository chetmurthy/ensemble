RELEASE_NOTES

  This distribution includes a first release of a Java Native
Interface (JNI) for Ensemble. It is based on the native C-interface
(CE), and provides safe access from Java to the raw performance of the
Ensemble messaging system. Preliminary tests show good performance in
terms of both latency and througput. Currently, the interface works
only on Linux, though it *should* work on other Unix like systems as
well.  If there is interest, it can be ported to windows. An
overview of the interface was added to the system tutorial, and
javadoc style documentation is also included.

A major bug effecting applications using flow-control with CE was
fixed. Other than that: 
1. Minor bugs were fixed
2. Some cleanups 
3. C++ compatibility headers were added to the CE .h files. This
   allows C++ applications to use CE.
4. The new version of the OCaml compiler, 3.06,  was used.
