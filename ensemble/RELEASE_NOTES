RELEASE_NOTES

1. Added a "local" stack, which simply adds property local to vsync. 

2. Some slight typing changes in the Hsys module, requested by Roy Friedman.

3. Removed spurious logical-time in outboard mode (HOT). This improves
   line-utilization for HOT applications using outboard mode.

4. Added outboard mode to CE. This allows using Ensemble though a
   server and a thin client library. This is a step forward in the
   rewrite of the HOT interface. Eventually, we intend to completely
   replace it with CE, using a thin overlay layer to mimic HOT semantics.

5. make depend now works on WIN32. The make sequence is now on all platforms:
    for bytecode:
      make depend
      make all
    for optimized code:
      make depend
      make opt

6. Added staggering to the Suspect and Stablity layers. This means
   that instead of a flood of messages sent when suspicions and
   stability information is computed, such events are scattered.  This
   prevents implosion at the group leader. This was suggested by Roy Friedman.

6. Some makefiles and build fixes
  - libceo.lib was not included in the library
  - make clean bug in CE

7. Conversion to dynamic linking for CE.

8. Documentation provided now in PDF and HTML formats, instead
   of postscript and HTML.

9. Build fixes for Maestro.

10. Fixes for the Java interface.

11. Started working on a Thread safe version of the CE libraries. 

OCAML COMPILER VERSION
  We are using version 3.04 for this version. 

PORTABILITY
