     RELEASE_NOTES for Ensemble version 1.37

RELEASE_NOTES

  This is mainly a bug fix release for several reference counting
bugs found in the Local and Total ordering protocols. Also included are 
a more type-safe way of handling ref-counts and an initial JNI
interface. 

  The included JNI interface will probably not change in the
future. It allows a mutli-threaded Java application to join and leave
groups. In a group context it may perform the standard Ensemble
actions: send, cast, rekey, etc. The problem with the current
implementation is that if the application does not adher to some
"good" programming discipline such as correct locking, it will get
segmentation faults. While this is good enough for C application
(e.g., in CE) it is not good enough for Java. In Java one would expect
to get an exception.

  Aside from the above several Makefiles were fixed, and a more complete set of 
C header files were copied into the lib directory. 

  As my company's standard practices requires not using its
E-mail for freeware development, I'm now using my Hebrew University
account for Ensemble issues. It is orodeh@alum.cs.huji.ac.il, you are
welcome to use it.
