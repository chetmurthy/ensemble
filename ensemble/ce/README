README: CE subdirectory
Author: Ohad Rodeh 9/2001

  The CE directory defines a C thin C-interface overlaid over
  the ML interface. To use the interface one should read the interface file
  (ce.h) and link with the library --- libce.a on Unix platforms, and 
  libce.lib on windows platforms. The documentation can be found in the
  doc subdirectory.

  In the future, CE will form the major C-interface to the system, 
  where HOT and Maestro are overlaid on top of it.

  The overhead, as measured on Linux, is very low, on the order on 10\%
  above the cost of direct ML calls. This should be lowered even
  further in the future. Currently messages are copied between C and ML,
  we intend to fix this, allowing for zero-copy.

Caveats: 
  Due to a bug in the current ocaml distribution, the library is a bit
  flaky on WIN32 platforms.
