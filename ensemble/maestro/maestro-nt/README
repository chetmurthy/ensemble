Outboard mode
-------------

In addition to the standard configuration, Ensemble can now be run
in the so called outboard mode.  In this mode Ensemble is started
in a separate process, and talks to the application process via a 
pipe.  There are several advantages in using the outboard mode:

(1) Memory corruption and synchronization bugs of the application are
    isolated from the Ensemble code.
(2) You can use purify with the application.
(3) Program size is smaller since the Ensemble library is not included,
    so it takes less time to link the application.  This is helpful in
    the development/debugging phase when you frequently recompile.

Disadvantages of the outboard mode are lower performance, running 
two processes instead of once, and the need to perform additional 
configuration steps, as described below.

There are two versions of the HOT library, libhot.a supporting the
standard "inboard" mode and libhoto.a for the outboard mode.  
In order to enable the outboard mode in Maestro/Ensemble applications, 
perform the following steps.

(1) Link the application with the libhoto.a library.  
    If Maestro is used, the HOT library is not linked in directly.
    Instead, it is included within the Maestro library (libmae.a).
    In this case make sure the Maestro library is built to contain libhoto.a
    rather than libhot.a.  This is controlled by the HOT_MODE option at the 
    top of the Maestro makefile.  Setting "HOT_MODE = inboard" will build
    Maestro/Ensemble library in the inboard mode.  Respectively for
    "HOT_MODE = outboard".

(2) Set the environment variable ENS_OUTBOARD to point to the location of the 
    outboard Ensemble program (usually found in ensemble/demo/outboard).
