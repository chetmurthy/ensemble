README: Ensemble Root directory
Author: Mark Hayden
Last updated: 26/10/2002, by Ohad Rodeh

  The design of the Ensemble system is based to a large
  degree on the C implementation of Horus at the Cornell
  University Computer Science Department, of which Robbert
  vanRenesse is the chief architect.  I have tried my best
  to credit the designer(s) of the original C code in
  modules that are based on the C implementation.  I would
  appreciate knowing of any instances in which I have
  improperly or incompletely credited pieces of this system.
