rand -add_prop total

--------------------------------------------------------
TODO for 1.37
-------------
14. Fix the rest of the total-ordering protocols: (Totem, Total, Sequencer?).

0. Add -fPIC to the CFLAGS.

1. Debug groupd : 
   - bug 1: uncaught exception
   - bug 2: refcount bug
2. Add a transport-mode document
3. Port to solaris.
4. Check what happens when we move sockets to OVERLAPPED on win32
5. Performance: 
  - 'ce_perf -rpc' spends A LOT of time converting ML sockets to C sockets.
  - Check other cases
  - perhaps write a paper on performance improvements and software experience
    between 1.00v and 1.36v.
6. The 32bit counter in ce_outboard, that counts stack ids, can overflow.
7. Fix the DLL version
8. Split out security and groupd
9. port the security-infrastructure to win32 (crypto++)
10. write a configure script (in ML)
11. Use the new Unix setsock calls for Unix part of socket/s
12. Port to ocaml-3.05 (use the direct marshaling C<->ML)
13. Convert from C directly to ML actions, instead of going through an intermidiate representation. 

done:
-----
1. Initial work on a JNI port for CE.
2. Fixed reference counting bugs in total-ordering and Local protocols.

--------------------------------------------------------

Check
-----
1. hot +
2. maestro + 
3. groupd +-  (rand -groupd_local)
4. HOT, outboard interface. + (need to run a VERY long test)
5. protos.
6. Check Hsyssupp. +
7. PGP, encryption/authentication +
8. Java.

ML suggestions:
---------------
1. Add a third generation to the GC.
2. optimize using registers returned tuples.
3. A substring library. 
4. Functional arrays and strings. This would allow
   optimizing "Array.map ident". 
    Array.map ident alpah_arr === alpha_arr.
5. Simple escape-analysis.

--------------------------------------------------------

Version 1.33
------------
1. Rewritten all the makefiles.
2. Update the INSTALL.htm file, to describe how the new makefiles work.
4. Add the copyright to the files.
5. Copyright violations have been fixed, the code is now clean, containing
   no CAML code. 
6. Work is underway to add IBM to the copyright holders. 
7. Use iovectors on WIN2000: (Check), does not really work. 

-----------------------------------------------------------
1.34
----
DONE
1. Added (almost) zero-copy to WIN32, and complete scatter-gather support.
2. Port CE to WIN32.
4. Port to ocaml-3.04.
5. Move java documentation to doc/

1.35
----
0. Re-Added zero-copy marhaling for ML applications. (!)
1. Check that ocamldep works (win32). +
2. Check that zero-copy marshaling is bug free.
4. complete porting of socktest to win32. reading from stdin does not
   work.

--------------------------------------------------------
TESTING: 

--------------------------------------------------------
1.36
----
4. More serious testing.
2. Shared libraries (Unix), Dlls (on windows).


Version 1.5
-----
2. Set log_iov inside Appl.monitor, instead of inside the stable 
   layer.
9. Add documentation for the way reference counting is performed, as well as descriptions of the Router/Transport/Alarm interfaces.
7. Check why we block in TCP recv.
6. Reduce header length from 8 to 4 bytes (ml_len,iovec_len).
0. Complete debugging the wbml application. 
1. groupd : support for SVS.
2. Throw out most of HOT by writing an outboard mode for CE.
