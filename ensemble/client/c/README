README: CE subdirectory
Author: Ohad Rodeh 9/2001

  The CE directory defines a C thin C-interface overlaid over
  the ML interface. To use the interface one should read the interface file
  (ce.h) and link with the library --- libce.a on Unix platforms, and 
  libce.lib on windows platforms. The documentation can be found in the
  doc subdirectory.

  In the future, CE will form the major C-interface to the system, 
  where HOT and Maestro are overlaid on top of it.

  The overhead, as measured on Linux, is very low, on the order of 10%
  above the cost of direct ML calls in the worst cases. This should be
  lowered even further in the future.
