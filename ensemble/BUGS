* Multicast does not work on NT very well. 
  - This is an NT problem. On win2000 this is ok.

* the groupd application is still not very stable
  - It does not support SVS

* TCP mode on large messages does not work very well.

* socktest does work on WIN32. This is due to a problem with
  reading input from stdin.
