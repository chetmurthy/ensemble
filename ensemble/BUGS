* the groupd application is still not very stable
  - It does not support SVS

* TCP mode on large messages does not work very well.

* win32 problems: 
  1) Multicast does not work on NT very well. 
     This is an NT problem. On win2000 this is ok.

  2) socktest does work on WIN32. This is due to a problem with
     reading input from stdin. 

  3) gossip server does not work well with UDP mode on win32. This
     seems to be a problem with winsock2.
