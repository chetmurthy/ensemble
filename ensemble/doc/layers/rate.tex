\begin{Layer}{RATE}

This layer implements a sender rate based flow control.  Multicast messages
from each sender are sent at a rate not exceeding some prescribed value.

\begin{Protocol}
All the messages to be sent are buffered initially.  Buffered messages are
sent on periodic timeouts that are set based on the sender's rate.
\end{Protocol}

\begin{Parameters}
\item
rate\_n, rate\_t: the pair determines the rate.  At most \mlval{rate\_n}
messages are allowed to sent over any time period of \mlval{rate\_t}.  This
is ensured by having two consecutive messages sent with a inter-send time
of at least $(rate\_t / rate\_n)$ apart.
\end{Parameters}

%\begin{Properties}
%\end{Properties}

\begin{Notes}
\item Future implementation should support dynamic rate adjustment.
\item Alternative flow control layers include CREDIT and WINDOW.
