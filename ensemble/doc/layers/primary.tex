\begin{Layer}{PRIMARY}

Detect primary partition in a group. Usually a primary partition has
the majority of members or holds some important resources.
\begin{Protocol}
Upon \UpInit\ event, a member sends a message to the coordinator,
claiming that it is in the current view. When a view has the majority
of members, its coordinator prompts a view change to make itself the
primary partition if it is not yet.  When a new view is ready, it
decides whether it is primary and mark it as so.
\end{Protocol}

\begin{Parameters}
\item primary\_quorum: how many servers (non-client member) are
needed to form the primary partition.
\end{Parameters}

\begin{Properties}
\item
Guarantees no two primary partitions can have the same logical timestamp.
\item
Optimal in the normal case: no addtional view change is necessary.
\item
This protocol requires group membership management from underlying
protocol layers. 
\end{Properties}
