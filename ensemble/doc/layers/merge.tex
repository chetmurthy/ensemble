\begin{Layer}{MERGE}

This protocol provides reliable retransmissions of merge messages and failure
detection of remote coordinators when merging.

\begin{Protocol}
Simple retransmission protocol.  A hash table is used to detect copied
merge requests, which are dropped.
\end{Protocol}

\begin{Parameters}
\item
merge\_sweep: how often to retransmit merge requests
\item
merge\_timeout: how long before timing out on merges
\end{Parameters}

\begin{Properties}
\item
\DnMerge, \DnMergeGranted, and \DnMergeDenied\ events are buffered for later
retransmission.
\item
\UpMergeRequest, \UpMergeGranted, and \UpMergeDenied\ events are filtered
so that each event is delivered at most once by this layer (i.e., so that
retransmissions are dropped).
\item
After $timeout$ time (a parameter listed above) an \UpMergeFailed\ event is
delivered with the problems field set to be the contact of the \DnMerge\
(only) event.  (It is assumed that the merge process will normally be
complete before this timeout occurs.)
\end{Properties}

\begin{Notes}
\item
Removal of this protocol layer only makes the merges unreliable, and
stops the failure detection of the new coordinator.
