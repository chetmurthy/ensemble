\begin{Layer}{TOPS}

This layer implements a lexicographic total ordering protocol.  (This is
a variation on the protocol developed as part of the Transis project.)

\begin{Protocol}
The protocol works by lexigraphically ordering messages. For example,
if group members are $\{ A, B, C \}$ and they send messages $A_1,
B_1,$ and $C_1,$ then the ordering will be $A_1 < B_1 < C_1$. Since
the ordering is fixed the protocol can get stuck if a member does not
send a message every timeout. For example, if the application messages
are $A_1$ and $C_1$ then the protocol would wait indefinitely for
$B_1$ and never deliver $C_1$. Hence, every member multicasts a null
message every timeout to maintain liveness. Currently, the timeout is
hardcoded to one second.

This protocol is not normally used because it has high latency 
if members do not multicast messages often.
