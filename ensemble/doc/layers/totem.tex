\begin{Layer}{TOTEM}

This layer implements the rotating token protocol for total ordering.  (This is
a variation on the protocol developed as part of the Totem project.)

\begin{Protocol}
The protocol here is fairly simple: As soon as the stack becomes valid, the
lowest ranked member starts rotating a token in the group. In order to send a
message, a process must wait for the token. When the token arrives, all
buffered messages are broadcast, and the token is passed to the next member.
The token must be passed on even if there are no buffered messages.

If a view change occurs, messages are tagged as unordered and are send as
such.
When the \Up{View} event arrives, indicating that the group has successfully
been flushed, these messages are delivered in a deterministic order everywhere
(according to the ranks of their senders, breaking ties using FIFO).
\end{Protocol}
