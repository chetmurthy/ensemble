\begin{abstract}
\ensemble\ is a reimplementation of the \horus\ reliable group communication
system in the \caml\ programming language.  This document describes:
\begin{itemize}
\item
How to configure and execute the applications included with \ensemble.
\item
The client application interface.
\item
The Server (OCaml) \ensemble\ application interface.
\end{itemize}

\section{Introduction}
This documentation assumes that the reader has some familiarity with group
communication. There are many texts that describe how to use and build
group-communication system.

Ensemble is structured as a client-server system with a server
providing group-communication services through a socket based
interface. Clients can connect to the server and send/receive reliable
point-to-point and multicast messages. There should be one server
running on a host, and clients should be located on the same
host. This allows using insecure communication for client-server
traffic.  The server is written (mostly) in the OCaml programming
language, the client is a small library that has
implementations in several languages. At the time of writing there are
clients in C and Java.

Previous versions of the system did not distinguish between client and
server. The client was implemented with an internal server. This
provides good performance. However, since the server is written in ML,
in order to link with a C program written by a user the
foreign-language interface of ML needs to be used. This causes very
difficult portability issues. As of release 2.00 we decided to
separate client from server; this should improve portability at the
expense of performance.

\part{The Server}
This chapter describes how to build server-side programs. The reason
users should be wary of writing such programs is that the server
operates in a soft read-time environment. The server is written in the
OCaml programming language, a single thread of execution is used. To
improve performance bulk-data for user messages is not allocated on
the ML heap, which is garbage collection, it is allocated on large
chunks of memory allocated with {\tt malloc}. Bulk-data extents are
also called io-vectors and the memory used to hold them is also called
iovec-memory. To reduce server memory foot-print the size of
iovec-memory is limited, at the time of writing we are using 6
mega-bytes. Since memory is limited memory-allocation can fail. The
server handles this with flow-control protocols limiting the amount of
incoming messages to fit the amount of available iovec-memory. In
order to maintain responsiveness to incoming messages pure CPU
processing (such as search on a database) should be limited. If the
messaging engine does not receive sufficient CPU every, say, 100
milliseconds then performance is going to suffer dramatically.

The casual user will be better served by the chapter on writing client
programs that do not suffer from these limitations. If, however, you
are undaunted then this chapter is for you.

\part{The Client}
The client library (or simply the ``client'') implements a message-passing
protocol between server and user. The protocol used is described in
the reference manual. The client-library has no internal threads. No
message-memory is allocated by the client, all messages are allocated
and freed by the user. This gives the user complete control on its
memory foot-print. The client is thread-safe, several threads can
send/recv messages concurrently. Blocking socket operations are used
to simplify client semantics.

In order to use the client-library the user application must first
connect to the server. It can then create group members and perform
a subset of Ensemble actions: Leave, Cast, Send, Send1, Suspect.
There are other Ensemble operations that we decided not to support
since they add more complexity than value. 

The application must poll Ensemble periodically to see if there are any
pending messages, and receive them. In the past, it was possible
for the application not to receive messages while continuing to create
new actions. This is now not possible. The application will be blocked
at some point before flooding the server.
