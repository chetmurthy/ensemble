\section{C \ensemble\ Application Interface}

The C application interface is very similar in design to the ML interface.  It is
still in the preliminary stage.  What does that mean?  That basically everything is
there, but some the design details have not been totally worked out yet.  And also
that the documentation is not complete.  If you wish to write an application in C, we
recommend you first read section~\ref{section:applintf} to understand how the
interface works.  Then look at the files in the \sourcecappl{} directory, in
particular \sourcecappl{mtalk.c}, to see how to write and compile a C application
with \ensemble.

\note{The C application interface is now in the \sourcehot{} directory and is under
development.}
