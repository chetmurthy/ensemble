*********************************************************************
*  PLEASE NOTE!!
*
*  The Ensemble public CVS repository is mainly used by Ensemble
*  developers.  The Ensemble source code here is NOT packaged for
*  distribution, but is in its "raw" form, which may include partial
*  or incomplete bug fixes, code still in development, extraneous
*  subdirectories, etc. and we cannot guarantee that this code will
*  even compile, as is.
*
*  The official, packaged releases are available, pretested and
*  ready for download from our website:
*
*  http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/Projects/Ensemble/license.html
*
*  If you still prefer to download from the CVS repository, please
*  read the following instructions under READ-ONLY access, to make
*  sure you do the "make depend" step before attempting to build.
*
*********************************************************************

If you want READ-WRITE access:
------------------------------	    

0) If you do not have a CVS account set up for you on ensemble01:

a) If you don't have a ssh public key then run ssh-keygen and press
enter three times.

b) Send your public key (~/.ssh/identity.pub) and your desired login to
tclark@cs.cornell.edu.

1) Put the following into your ~/.ssh/config file:

Host ensemble01.cs.cornell.edu
Port 80
FallBackToRsh no
ForwardX11 no
User <username on ensemble machine>

2) Set environment variable CVS_RSH to `which ssh`.

3) Make sure you are using cvs version >=1.9 (cvs -v gets version).
Note that 1.10 is in /usr/local/gnu/cvs-1.10/bin under Solaris.

4) To create new working copy:

cvs -d :ext:ensemble01.cs.cornell.edu:/cvsroot checkout ensemble

5) To fix old repository:

a) Put the following in the /tmp/fixrep.sh :

#!/bin/sh
echo :ext:ensemble01.cs.cornell.edu:/cvsroot > $1/Root
(echo 's|/ensemble|/--ensemble-root-dir--|'; echo 's|^.*/--ensemble-root-dir--|/cvsroot/ensemble|'; echo w; echo q) | ed $1/Repository

b) chmod 755 /tmp/fixrep.sh

c)
find <old repository directory> -type d -name CVS -exec /tmp/fixrep.sh \{\} \;


If you only want READ-ONLY access:
----------------------------------

0) Log into the server by running 

% cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@ensemble01.cs.cornell.edu:/cvsroot login

The password is anoncvs. It will be stored on your computer,
so you only have to run the login command once. 

1) Now you can checkout the distribution by running:

% cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@ensemble01.cs.cornell.edu:/cvsroot checkout ensemble

2) Once you have checked out the ensemble distribution, you must cd to the 
   top-level "ensemble" directory and type "make depend".  This will create
   the required dependency files.  This step is mandatory, or the make process
   will fail.

3) After "make depend" completes, read the INSTALL.htm (or INSTALL.txt) file
   for instructions on how to build Ensemble.
