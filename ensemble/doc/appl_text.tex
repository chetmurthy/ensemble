\section{Text-based Application Interface}

This is the simplest of the \ensemble\ application interfaces in the
sense that it is totally language independent.  Read
section~\ref{section:ensemble-demo} describing the
\sourcedemo{ensemble} tool.  A text-based application can easily be
built using this tool.  The idea is to run the \sourcedemo{ensemble}
program as a sub-process of an application, connected via a pair of
pipes.  The \ensemble\ sub-process will manage the communication.
This way the application be built in just about any programming
language, especially languages such as Tcl, Perl, and Python.  This
method suffers from considerably higher communication overheads than
single-process solutions.
