\section{Appendix: ML Does Not Allow Segmentation Faults}

Normally, \ensemble\ should never experience segmentation faults.  When they occur,
there are only a few possible causes.  We list these below along with fixes.  Please
inform Mark Hayden (hayden\@pa.dec.com) if you detect other sources of
``unsafety'' in \ensemble.
\begin{itemize}
\item
One of the \ensemble\ extensions to \caml\ written in C (in the
\sourcecode{socket} directory) may have a bug.  Most (all?) extensions have
equivalent ML implementations.  Use those and see if the bug goes away.
\end{itemize}
