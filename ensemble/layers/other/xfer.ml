(* XFER.ML : determines state tranfer views *)
(* Author: Mark Hayden, 3/96 *)
(* With suggestions by Samuel Weber *)
(**************************************************************)
(* Rules for determining whether a view is a state transfer
 * view.
 *
 * Singleton views are *never* XFER views.
 *
 * Non-singleton views are XFER if (A or (B and not C)) holds.
 * Where A, B, and C are:
 *
 *   A. This view was merged from several previous views.
 *      This property is checked in EView when the new
 *      view is ready.
 *
 *   B. Previous view was a XFER view.  This property is
 *      also checked un EView when the new view is ready.
 *
 *   C. All members in previous view took XferDone action.
 *      This property is checked at the coordinator in EView
 *      when sending new view out.  The coordinator examines
 *      the xfer_done array, which marks which members did
 *      XferDone in the current view (and sent message to
 *      the coordinator.
 *)

(* NOTE: the Primary protocol requires that the xfer field
 * in the view state be set by the time the EView event is
 * going up the protocol stack.  
 *)
