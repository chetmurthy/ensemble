README: Protocol Layer Directory
Author: Mark Hayden
Last updated: 10/23/99

This directory and its subdirectories contain source code for the
Ensemble protocol layers.  Read the Ensemble reference manual for
documentation on layers and their general structure.

(+ denotes that a module has known or suspected bugs)

DEBUGGING LAYERS
  assert   	does basic tests on Horus layers
+ chk_merge   	tests merge layer
  chk_fifo      tests for FIFO ordering
+ chk_stable   	tests for stability detection
  chk_sync      tests for synchronization properties
  chk_total	tests for totally ordered broadcasts
  delay		inserts event delays to trigger bugs (Ohad Rodeh)
  chk_causal	tests for causal delivery (Ohad Rodeh)


VIRTUAL SYNCHRONY: these layers compose to provide group membership
  leave         group leave protocol
  sync          synchronization protocol for blocking group
                during view changes
  inter         inter-group merges
  intra		intra-group failures, views
  elect		leader election
  merge   	reliable merge protocol
  pt2pt   	reliable, FIFO point-to-point protocol
  mnak          reliable, FIFO broadcast protocol
  stable   	broadcast stability
  suspect	failure detection
  bottom        core communication
  slander	suspicion sharing (Zhen Xiao)


GOSSIP LAYERS
  heal   	automatic partition healing
  switch	protocol switching layer


SCALABLE LAYERS
  pr_stable	probabilistic stability protocol
  pr_suspect	probabilistic failure detection
+ gcast		gossip-style broadcast  
+ asym		routes messages in asymmetric networks


TRANSIS LAYERS
  tcausal	Transis causal ordering layer (Ohad Rodeh)


FLOW CONTROL
  rate   	rate-based flow control (Takako Hickey)
  credit   	credit-based flow control (Takako Hickey)
  window   	window-based flow control (Takako Hickey)
  pt2ptc        credit-based point-to-point flow control
  mflow         credit-based flow control (with Zhen Xiao)


TOTAL ORDERING PROTOCOLS
+ total   	original Horus total ordering protocol (requires local layer beneath)
  totem   	Totem protocol (with Roy Friedman)
  sequencer     sequencer-based protocol (with Roy Friedman)


SECURITY
  exchange	key exchange protocol
  rekey		rekey the group (with Zhen Xiao)
  encrypt	application data encryption


OTHER LAYERS
  top           usually the topmost layer in any stack
  top_appl   	application layer
  local         local delivery of broadcasts
  subcast   	converts sends to broadcasts
  migrate       support for migrating members
  primary	primary partition support (with Zhen Xiao)

BYPASS
+ bypass        bypass protocol
+ bypfifo       bypass protocol (just lower layers)



OUT-OF-DATE (or not in distribution)
  merge.karr
+ chk_acks      tests acknowledgement operations
  typical
